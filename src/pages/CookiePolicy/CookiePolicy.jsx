        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          1.1 This Cookie Policy ("Policy") describes how Acast AB (publ), its
          affiliates ("Acast", "us", "we" or "our"), partners and service
          providers uses cookies and similar technologies such as scripts, SDKs,
          web beacons, tracking pixels, plugins and other similar technologies
          (collectively, "Cookies") when providing you with the Acast services
          (the "Services") or when you access any website owned and controlled
          by Acast (the "Websites"). Through this Policy, we aim to explain
          which Cookies we use, for what purposes and, most importantly, what
          choices you have for managing your Cookie settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          1.2 It is important for you to understand that by using the Services
          and/or Websites, you agree to the terms of this Policy and consent to
          the use of Cookies by Acast in accordance with the terms of the
          Policy. Consequently, if you do not agree to these terms, we ask you
          to not use the Services and/or Websites.
        </p>

        <h3>2. What are cookies and similar technologies?</h3>

        <p>
          2.1 A Cookie is a small text file downloaded onto your device (such as
          your computer, mobile phone, tablet or other similar device) when you
          visit a website and use its functions, or use an app. Cookies allow to
          recognize your device and are used by website owners to operate their
          website and services more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          2.2 Cookies are widely used to understand how the website or service
          is being used by you, to help you navigate between pages more
          efficiently, to help you remember your preferences, such as language
          preferences or login information, to ensure that ads you see online
          are relevant to you and your interests, and more generally to improve
          your online browsing experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          2.3 Cookies may also be used to collect information that is personal
          to you. In such cases, the Acast Privacy Policy (GDPR or ROW, as
          applicable) will apply in addition to this Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>3. How do we use Cookies?</h3>

        <p>
          3.1 Acast uses both first-party and third-party cookies. First-party
          cookies are set by us and are associated with the domain of our
          website, www.acast.com along with its subdomains. Third-party cookies
          are set by our partners and service providers on our behalf and are
          associated with a domain different from the domain of the website you
          are visiting. Such Cookies enable third-party features and
          functionalities, such as delivering personalised advertisements and
          content or performing ad measurement analytics, to be provided through
          the Services and/or Websites.
        </p>

        <p>
          3.2 A Cookie can be either a session Cookie or a persistent Cookie. A
          persistent Cookie is stored until it reaches a defined expiration date
          (which can be minutes, days or several years in the future). A session
          Cookie has no expiration timestamp assigned to it and is stored until
          your login session is no longer active in your web browser.
        </p>
