It is also the jubilee of Sister Evangelina taking holy orders. We also meet Mrs Harper, whose daughter Sally, a young woman with Downs Syndrome, is pregnant. The father, cerebral palsy sufferer Jacob, lives in the same residential home, and they declare that they are in love and aim to marry, but the baby is stillborn, and Jacob is sent to another home. News of Evangelina's celebration attracts her brother Vincent, now an alcoholic tramp, and she steals food for him and sees him admitted to the hospital.

Along with a group of midwives, the Turners, Fred and Tom, she arrives at the clinic to assist its lone medic, Myra Fitzsimmons, and they are shocked by the lack of supplies and the rudimentary conditions, with Phyllis delivering a baby under a tree in the desert. They also encounter Apartheid and dysentery caused by the lack of clean water. Worst of all, Dr Myra is convinced she has cancer. Before they return to England, Trixie has performed a Caesarean, Sister Julienne has persuaded a gruff white landowner to run a freshwater pipeline through his property, and Dr Turner has good news for Myra, all allowing the clinic to continue. At the same time, Barbara and Tom have good news of their own!",

Valerie trawls through the drifts to the caravan where pregnant Linda is staying with the adoring Selwyn, who knows he is not her baby's father, for a potentially upsetting early birth, whilst Sister Julienne hears a shocking story of domestic abuse when she visits the wife of a hypothermia victim. Come the New Year, the pantomime goes ahead, and Phyllis gets the better of an officious policeman, but Tom is faced with a difficult decision.",
